Among the `*.rs` files:

1. `evercrypt.rs` was generated with Rust's `bindgen`  via
   `share/pulse/examples/dice/common/hacl-rust/gen-rust-bindings.sh`
2. Some files have a header "This file is generated by the Pulse2Rust tool"
3. All other files are handwritten

In particular, `evercrypt_*.rs` are handwritten for the following reasons:
* names do not match
* unit and Ghost arguments are erased away from the Karamel-generated
  `.h` file, but not from the `.rs` file
* array argument types do not match: arrays extracted from Pulse are
  of type `&mut [T]`, whereas array types generated by `bindgen` are
  of the form `*mut T`
