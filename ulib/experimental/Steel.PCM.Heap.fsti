open Steel.PCM

/// This module defines the behavior of a structured heap where each memory cell is governed by
/// a partial commutative monoid. This PCM structure is reused for the entire heap as it is possible
/// to talk about disjoint heaps and join them together.
///
/// In a sense, a heap here can be seen as a partial heap, containing a partial view of the state of
/// the memory. Combining disjoint heaps is then equivalent to conciling two partial views of the
/// memory together. This is our base for separation logic.
///
/// The heap is instrumented with affine heap predicates, heap predicates that don't change if you
/// augment the heap on which they're valid by joining another partial heap. These affine heap
/// predicates are the terms of our separation logic.
///
/// Finally, the module defines actions for heap, which are frame-preserving heap updates.

  contents of memory cells.

(**** Separation logic over heaps *)

(**
  An affine heap proposition or affine heap predicate is a proposition whose validity does not
  change if the heap on which it is valid grows. In other terms, it is a proposition that is
  compatible with the disjoint/join operations for partial heaps. These affine heap predicates
  are the base of our separation logic.
*)
let heap_prop_is_affine (p:heap u#a -> prop) : prop =
  forall (h0 h1: heap u#a). p h0 /\ disjoint h0 h1 ==> p (join h0 h1)

(**
  [slprop] stands for "separation logic proposition", and is precisely an affine heap
  proposition.
*)
let slprop : Type u#(a + 1) = p:(heap u#a -> prop) { heap_prop_is_affine p }

(**
  Because they are heap predicates, [slprop]s can be "interpreted" over any heap, yielding a
  [prop]
*)
val interp (p:slprop u#a) (m:heap u#a) : prop

(**
  An [hprop] is a weaker form of affine heap predicate, since it is only affine for heaps
  that already satisfy the separation logic proposition [fp]. [fp] stands for the "footprint" of
  the [hprop]
*)
let hprop (fp:slprop u#a) =
  q:(heap u#a -> prop){
    forall (h0:heap{interp fp h0}) (h1:heap{disjoint h0 h1}).
      q h0 <==> q (join h0 h1)

(** A common abbreviation: [hheap p] is a heap on which [p] is valid *)
let hheap (p:slprop u#a) = m:heap u#a {interp p m}

  Equivalence relation on [slprop]s is just

(***** Basic properties of separation logic *)

(** If [p * q] is valid on [h], then [p] and [q] are valid on [h] *)
val affine_star (p q:slprop) (h:heap)
  : Lemma ((interp (p `star` q) h ==> interp p h /\ interp q h))

(** Equivalence of separation logic propositions is symmetric *)
val equiv_symmetric (p1 p2:slprop)
  : squash (p1 `equiv` p2 ==> p2 `equiv` p1)

(** If [p1 ~ p2] then [p1 * p3 ~ p2 * p3] *)
val equiv_extensional_on_star (p1 p2 p3:slprop)
  : squash (p1 `equiv` p2 ==> (p1 `star` p3) `equiv` (p2 `star` p3))

(** [p ~ p * emp] *)
val emp_unit (p:slprop)
  : Lemma (p `equiv` (p `star` emp))

(** Introduction rule for equivalence of [h_exists] propositions *)
val h_exists_cong (#a:Type) (p q : a -> slprop)
    : Lemma
      (requires (forall x. p x `equiv` q x))
      (ensures (h_exists p `equiv` h_exists q))

(**
  The interpretation of a separation logic proposition [hp] is itself an [hprop] of footprint
  [hp]
*)
val interp_depends_only_on (hp:slprop u#a)
    : Lemma
      (forall (h0:hheap hp) (h1:heap u#a{disjoint h0 h1}).
        interp hp h0 <==> interp hp (join h0 h1))


(***** [pts_to] properties *)

(**
  [ptr r] is a separation logic proposition asserting the existence of an allocated cell at
  reference [r]
*)
let ptr (#a: Type u#a) (#pcm: pcm a) (r:ref a pcm) =
    h_exists (pts_to r)

(**
  If we have [pts_to x v0] and [pts_to y v1] on the same heap, then [v0] and [v1] are are related
  by the PCM governing [x]. Indeed, the [pts_to] predicate is not stricly injective, as our partial
  heaps offer only a partial view on the contents of the memory cell. This partial view is governed
  by [pcm], and this lemma shows that you can combine two [pts_to] predicates into a third, with
  a new value with is the composition of [v0] and [v1] by [pcm].
  This lemma is equivalent to injectivity of [pts_to] if you instantiate [pcm] with the exclusive
  PCM.
*)

      (ensures
        composable pcm v0 v1 /\
        interp (pts_to x (op pcm v0 v1)) h
      )

(***** Properties of separating conjunction *)

(** The separating conjunction [star] arises from the disjointness of partial heaps *)
val intro_star (p q:slprop) (hp:hheap p) (hq:hheap q)
    : Lemma
      (requires disjoint hp hq)
      (ensures interp (p `star` q) (join hp hq))

(** [star] is commutative *)
val star_commutative (p1 p2:slprop)
    : Lemma ((p1 `star` p2) `equiv` (p2 `star` p1))

(** [star] is associative *)
val star_associative (p1 p2 p3:slprop)
    : Lemma (
      (p1 `star` (p2 `star` p3))
      `equiv`
      ((p1 `star` p2) `star` p3)
    )

(** If [p1 ~ p3] and [p2 ~ p4], then [p1 * p2 ~ p3 * p4] *)
val star_congruence (p1 p2 p3 p4:slprop)
  : Lemma (requires p1 `equiv` p3 /\ p2 `equiv` p4)
          (ensures (p1 `star` p2) `equiv` (p3 `star` p4))

(***** Properties of the refinement *)

(** [h_refine p q] is just interpreting the affine heap prop [q] when [p] is valid *)
val refine_interp (p:slprop u#a) (q:slprop u#a) (h:heap u#a)
    : Lemma (interp p h /\ q h <==> interp (h_refine p q) h)

(**
  Equivalence on [h_refine] propositions is define by logical equivalence of the refinements
  on all heaps
*)
val refine_equiv (p0 p1:slprop u#a) (q0 q1:slprop u#a)
    : Lemma (p0 `equiv` p1 /\ (forall h. q0 h <==> q1 h) ==>
             equiv (h_refine p0 q0) (h_refine p1 q1))

(**
  A [pure] separation logic predicate is a refinement on the empty heap. That is how we
  lift pure propositions to the separation logic world
*)
let pure (p:prop) = h_refine emp (fun _ -> p)

(** Equivalence of pure propositions is the equivalence of the underlying propositions *)
val pure_equiv (p q:prop)
  : Lemma ((p <==> q) ==> (pure p `equiv` pure q))

(** And the interpretation of pure propositions is their underlying propositions *)
val pure_interp (q:prop) (h:heap u#a)
   : Lemma (interp (pure q) h <==> q)

(** A helper lemma for interpreting a pure proposition with another [slprop] *)

   : Lemma (interp (p `star` pure q) h <==>
            interp (p `star` emp) h /\ q)

(***** Magic wand and implications properties *)

(** We can define a [stronger] relation on [slprops], defined by interpretation implication *)
let stronger (p q:slprop) =
  forall h. interp p h ==> interp q h

(** [stronger] is stable when adding another starred [slprop] *)
val stronger_star (p q r:slprop)
  : Lemma (stronger q r ==> stronger (p `star` q) (p `star` r))

(** If [q > r] and [p * q] is valid, then [p * r] is valid *)
val weaken (p q r:slprop) (h:heap u#a)
  : Lemma (q `stronger` r /\ interp (p `star` q) h ==> interp (p `star` r) h)

(**** Actions *)

(**
  This modules exposes a preorder that is respected for every well-formed update of the heap.
  The preorder represents the fact that once a reference is allocated, its type and PCM cannot
  change and the trace of values contained in the PCM respects the preorder induced by the
  PCM (see Steel.PCM.Preorder).
*)
val heap_evolves : FStar.Preorder.preorder heap

(**
  This predicate allows us to maintain an allocation counter, as all references above [a]
  in [h] are free.
*)
val free_above_addr (h:heap u#a) (a:nat) : prop

(** [free_above_addr] is abstract but can be weakened consistently with its intended behavior *)
val weaken_free_above (h:heap) (a b:nat)
  : Lemma (free_above_addr h a /\ a <= b ==> free_above_addr h b)

(**
  The base type for an action is indexed by two separation logic propositions, representing
  the heap specification of the action before and after.
*)
let pre_action (fp:slprop u#a) (a:Type u#b) (fp':a -> slprop u#a) =
  hheap fp -> (x:a & hheap (fp' x))

(**
  We only want to consider heap updates that are "frame-preserving", meaning that they only
  modify the portion of the heap that they're allowed to, without messing with any other
  partial view of the heap that is compatible with the one you own. This includes :
  - preserving correct interpretation in presence of a frame;
  - evolving the heap according to the heap preorder;
  - not allocating any new references;
  - preserving the validity of any heap proposition affecting any frame
