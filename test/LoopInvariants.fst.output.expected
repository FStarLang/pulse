* Info at LoopInvariants.fst(64,17-64,20):
  - Expected failure:
  - When using multiple invariants, they must all be in the "new" style without a binder.

* Info at LoopInvariants.fst(76,20-77,8):
  - Expected failure:
  - Could not prove equality of:
  - Pulse.Lib.Reference.pts_to s 3
  - Pulse.Lib.Reference.pts_to s 2
  - Assertion failed
  - The SMT solver could not prove the query. Use --query_stats for more
    details.
